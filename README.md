# C-Sharp-and-Unity-Projects
## Introduction
In this project I have made a 2d game that has similar features and gameplay mechanics to Space Invaders but I have designed and coded it differently. In this game the goal will be to defeat all enemies in order for the player to reach the win screen. This game includes a menu, a point system, a win and game over screen, player and enemy interaction and more.
